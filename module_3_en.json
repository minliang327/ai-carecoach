              "what": "Cough: Observe nature (dry/wet cough), sound (hoarse/metallic), duration, and associated symptoms.",
              "why": "Coughing is a respiratory tract irritation reflex; the nature and tone can suggest the site and type of lesion.",
              "when": "Report to the doctor if persistent coughing lasts over 2 weeks or is accompanied by hemoptysis or fever; dry cough with chest pain should raise suspicion of pleurisy.",
              "scenario": "The caregiver finds the elderly person has recurrent dry cough at night, records the frequency, and suggests a medical visit to rule out chronic bronchitis."

              "what": "Dyspnea: Identify type and associated symptoms (orthopnea, cyanosis, nasal flaring).",
              "why": "Dyspnea reflects impaired gas exchange; posture and associated manifestations can help determine the cause (cardiac or pulmonary).",
              "when": "Immediately administer oxygen and report if orthopnea, respiratory rate $>24$ breaths/min, or cyanosis occurs.",
              "scenario": "The patient suddenly feels chest tightness and shortness of breath after a shower, the caregiver helps them adopt an orthopneic position and starts oxygen therapy."

              "what": "Constipation: Bowel movements less than 3 times per week, hard stool, accompanied by abdominal distension and difficulty defecating.",
              "why": "Reduced peristalsis and insufficient water intake are common causes in the elderly; chronic constipation can lead to hemorrhoids or fecal impaction.",
              "when": "Report to the doctor if no bowel movement for over 3 days or accompanied by abdominal pain; immediate first aid is needed if fainting occurs after straining during defecation.",
              "scenario": "Grandma Wang has not defecated for 4 days, the caregiver records the situation, performs abdominal massage, and assesses whether a glycerin enema is needed."

              "what": "Diarrhea: Loose or watery stools accompanied by abdominal pain, dehydration, and fever.",
              "why": "Diarrhea is a common manifestation of gastrointestinal infection or food intolerance; prevention of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance is necessary.",
              "when": "If diarrhea is $>3$ times/day or accompanied by a temperature $>38â„ƒ$, collect a specimen for testing and provide fluid replacement.",

              "what": "Pressure Injury: Stage I non-blanchable erythema, Stage II superficial ulcer, Stage III-IV deep tissue destruction.",
              "why": "Prolonged pressure leads to local tissue ischemia and necrosis; early detection can reverse the lesion.",
              "when": "Check the skin over bony prominences twice daily (morning and evening) for bedridden patients; immediately relieve pressure and record if non-blanchable erythema is found.",
              "scenario": "The caregiver finds redness over the sacrococcygeal area during the morning bath, immediately turns the patient to relieve pressure and notifies the nurse for assessment."

              "why": "The sitting position can reduce diaphragm pressure and improve lung ventilation; timely oxygen administration can relieve hypoxia.",

              "what": "Chest Physiotherapy (Percussion) for Sputum Clearance: Avoid the spine and breast areas, 10-15 minutes each time.",
              "why": "Percussion promotes sputum mobilization and expulsion; avoiding bony prominences prevents injury.",
              "when": "Avoid percussion within 1 hour after meals or within 48 hours post-operatively; contraindicated for patients with hemoptysis.",

              "why": "Massage promotes peristalsis; regular bowel movements prevent impaction.",
              "when": "Observe bowel movements daily for patients who are long-term bedridden or taking analgesics, as they are prone to constipation.",
